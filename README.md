# ForeignDictionary
This app will translate your words to the language you choose from dropdown list.
I put there only a few languages, can add more in the future.
The app requires a login -> username: admin, password: admin
After logging in, you will see that you can create a name for your directory which is attached to one language.
After that you choose which dictionary you want the words to be written in and afterwards you can create as many words as you want.
Each word is managable so you can delete it, re-write it and program automatically save them to local storage.
After downloading npm packages, the code should run on localhost:3000 without any problem with npm run start command :)
